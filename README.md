# Insurance-Data-Project
This project showcases the major locations in which insurance companies should target customers for life insurance policies. 
I originally took the counties in the state of California that had a population over 100,000. For this project I used the data that had the rate of age related premature deaths which essentially are the deaths that occurs before the average age of death. This death rate is essentially calculated by the total expected deaths divided by the total "standard population" which is then multiplied by 100,000. In this project I used deaths under the age of 75. I scraped the data for all 36 counties from FRED economic data which is a highly trustworthy source. After scraping data I programmed using R-Studio and had my data in an Excel spreadsheet.
For the results I found out that the county with the highest age related premature death rate was Imperial county with a rating of 524.2. On the other hand The lowest
was Santa Clara county with a rating of 212.5. However just comparing the premature death rate does not really mean much. This is
because a county with a high population can have a significantly big death rate also. This is why for my results I incorporated the population as well as the death
rate. As you can see from the results and the graphs down below the best place for an insurance company to target would be Santa Clara, Kern and Alameda counties.
These three counties described above all had a population in the 25th percentile and all also have a really low death rate. Moreover, the counties with the highest
risks were Imperial and San Bernardino counties. These two counties had the highest age related premature death rate and also have a decently sized population.



I have attached all the graphs down below for a more visual representation.

With this information insurance companies can specifically advertise and target the counties with a higher population and a less death rate.
